--- MODELS ---

/model/main.blend = The main blender file containing the dinning room scene. Other models have been linked into this scene.
/model/table.blend = The model for the table.
/model/chair.blend = The model for the chair, it has been mirrored to produce multiple.
/model/rug.blend = The model for the rug. Created using the hair particle effect system.
/model/place_settings.blend = The model for the place settings. Containing bowl, plate, cutlery and glass.
/model/cutlery.blend = The model for the knife and fork linked into the place settings model.
/model/glass.blend = The model for the glass linked into the place settings model.
/model/candle = The model for the candle which has been lit by using materials and the node system.

--- FEATURES AND TECHNIQUES ---

All models have been linked into main.blend by creating a group in each of their own .blend project.

Several effects and modifiers were used throughout the development of the scene. Most noticeably, include the use of the hair particle system when creating the rug.
Also the mirror modifier was used to create symmetric objects which was particularly useful when modeling the chair and table. The flame on the candle was also made
using an array modifier and applying an emmision material that was set based on a temperature node in the node system. The subdivison modifer was also used to produce
a round / curve look on multiple objects. Point lighting was used to simulate accurate lighting in the scene. The spin tool was used to help created some rounded shape
such as the bowl.

--- HOW MODELS RELATE ---

place_settings.blend = cutlery.blend + glass.blend
main.blend = table.blend + chair.blend + rug.blend + place_settings.blend + candle.blend

--- ANIMATION ---

The animation uses a bezier curve to create a path around the scene. A camera is added with constraints to follow this path and focus on the candle as it moves around.
